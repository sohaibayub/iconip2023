# Replication Package for "Towards Unveiling the Potential of Fuzzy Values as Features: A Comparative Study in Cybercrime Text Analysis"

This repository contains the replication package for the paper titled **"Towards Unveiling the Potential of Fuzzy Values as Features: A Comparative Study in Cybercrime Text Analysis"**. The paper presents a comparative study on the use of fuzzy values as features in the analysis of cybercrime text.

## Abstract

The paper explores the potential of fuzzy values as features in the analysis of cybercrime text. It compares the performance of traditional feature extraction methods with the utilization of fuzzy values, aiming to unveil their effectiveness in capturing the nuances and uncertainties present in cybercrime text. The study evaluates the performance of different classification algorithms on various cybercrime datasets, employing both traditional and fuzzy-based feature sets. The results demonstrate the advantages and limitations of using fuzzy values as features in cybercrime text analysis.
